# Covid-19 EDA using PySpark

The present repository contains code written in Python, in order to perform loading, preprocessing and exploratory analysis on a [dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/README.md) created and maintained by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/).

As mentioned in the notebook, PySpark is supposed to be implemented on much larger datasets, the volume of which cannot be handled by libraries such as Pandas. For this reason, the notebook is more of an educational introduction to data analytical methods by using PySpark, rather than an extensive analysis on the dataset.
